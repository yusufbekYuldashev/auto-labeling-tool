# Auto Labeling Tool

The **Auto Labeling Tool** is a project aimed at simplifying and automating the image labeling process. It features a single-page graphical user interface (GUI) developed using **PyQt6**, integrates the **lang-segment-anything** library to facilitate image labeling with text prompts, and includes scripts to export the labeled data in multiple formats such as **LabelMe JSON** or **YOLOv8** label file formats.

## Features

- **Single-Page GUI**: A user-friendly interface built using **PyQt6** to manage and process the labeling workflow.
- **Text Prompt-Based Labeling**: Leverages the **lang-segment-anything** library to label images efficiently based on user-defined text prompts.
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Supports exporting labeled data in **LabelMe JSON format** or **YOLOv8 label file format**, ensuring compatibility with various machine learning workflows.
